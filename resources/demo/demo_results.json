This suggests that Dr. Carter likely has specialized knowledge in treating heart conditions and may frequently prescribe Beta Blockers as part of treatment plans.\n\nPotential next steps could involve investigating the specific contexts or conditions under which Dr. Carter recommends Beta Blockers, such as the types of patients or the severity of their conditions. Additionally, comparing Dr. Carter's prescription patterns with those of other cardiologists could provide insights into best practices or variations in treatment approaches within the medical community. A missing element in the current query results is direct evidence of the recommendation itself; future queries might seek to confirm the relationship between Dr. Carter and Beta Blockers prescriptions directly from patient records or prescription databases."
